<h1>Hearth Disease Prediction</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Project Overview:
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease in individuals based on clinical and lifestyle features. Early detection of heart disease can significantly improve treatment outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. The model aims to assist healthcare professionals in identifying at-risk patients using data-driven insights.

Problem Statement:
Cardiovascular diseases remain one of the leading causes of death globally. Accurately predicting whether a person has heart disease based on available health metrics is crucial for timely intervention. The objective of this project is to build a binary classification model that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using patient data.

Model Approach:
- <b>Utilized a labeled dataset containing patient records with features such as age, sex, cholesterol level, resting blood pressure, chest pain type, and ECG results.</b>
- </b>Performed data preprocessing: a.Handled missing values and encoded categorical features b.Standardized numerical variables</b>
- </b>Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature relationships and correlations.</b>

Built and tested  machine learning model: </b>
- </b>Applied Logistic Regression, a suitable algorithm for binary classification tasks</b>
- </b>Evaluated model performance using metrics </b>



<h2>Skills </h2>

- <b>Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)</b>
- <b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</b>
- <b>Feature engineering</b>
- <b>Logistic Regression</b>
- <b>Model evaluation and interpretation</b>

<h2>Outcomes </h2>

- <b>Successfully built a Logistic Regression model capable of predicting the presence of heart disease with strong performance metrics. This project demonstrates how machine learning can support early diagnosis and contribute to preventive healthcare solutions.</b>
